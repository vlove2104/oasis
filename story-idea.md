# Story Idea

My story is about a young professional who had, all her life, made the lives of other around her better at the expense of herself. Everytime she is faced with a situation, she cannot help making the choice that benefits other at her own expense.

Her life takes a turn for the worse when she gives up the apartment that she had rented with her long-time friend and is left homeless. Forced to stay at the office, she has a month to find a new place before her boss returns and learns of her squatting. Her salvation comes in the form on the new employee, Ben, who was looking for a roommate after his breakup in order to afford the rent.
